Tech stack: React, node, sql. using vite as framework for react (front end)
let's get weird

Start Guide.
these commands work for linux and mac I think idk about windows. also chatgpt and google will be better help than this
1. Check if you have node and npm installed already. 
    node -v
    npm -v
    If not, install via nodejs.org - npm automatically comes with node.
    Install this globally probs unless you don't want to

2. Clone this repo
    git clone https://github.com/jbaremoney/emrks455/tree/5d448420e608d794406921029c0392a2c3c6d7c9/emrks455

3. Navigate to repo cd emrks455

4. *** Navigate to client folder (where react stuff is, keeping front and backend separate) ... cd client ... this part is IMPORTANT because initialized separate package managers for front and backend

5. Project framework is vite, already initialized and dependencies defined, so running 'npm install' will automatically get you right

6. Can run 'npm run dev' before start coding to have a url for browser to see live updates. (locally hosting) 

7. Should probably work on own branches, create own branch and push changes there instead of main, we can all confirm each other's code and merge when good.
